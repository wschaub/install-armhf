install-armhf is a tool created by Konstantinos Margaritis that does the following:
1) partitions and puts filesystems on either an SD card or internal SSD drive

2) runs debootstrap to put a full debian root filesystem on the drive

3) adds extra packages to the image

4) applies any Efika MX specific tweaks to the default debian system.

5) installs the Efika MX kernel and sets up the boot script.

I intend to make modifications to this script in this github repo. you can find the original at http://people.debian.org/~markos/armhf/efika-installer/install-armhf.tar.xz
